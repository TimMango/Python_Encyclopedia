    "The Udemy class details four separate ways to install Spark.\n",
    "1. Use Ubuntu and a VirtualBox (no thanks; doing this to make all systems work for vid)\n",
    "2. Install locally, run on AWS EC clusters (slow, free for a year)\n",
    "3. Use databricks.com for online hosting of Spark instances, free 6 GB tier (yes)\n",
    "4. Install locally, run on AWS RedShift (fast and nice, not free)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most logical way for work outside the class is to install locally and then run it on a cluster somewhere.  Running it all locally is doable for the class, but for truly \"big\" data that isn't an option (hence why Spark was developed in the first place, to handle sets of data that are too large to fit on a single machine).  Thus, installing locally and hosting on a cluster will be the ultimate use case at some point.  I just didn't do it for this class because of the AWS headache.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark was written in Scala (and, if possible, it is best to use Scala with Spark.  I don't have any Scala experience so I'm using Python's PySpark for now), which itself comes from Java.  In order to install and run Spark locally, you will need the latest Java Virtual Machine (JVM) [development kit installed](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).  Since it comes from Oracle, there is a fair amount of surreptitious bloatware and insidious packages installed.  Google for the best ways to remove them from your machine, especially if you have an otherwise spyware-free Mac."

    "### Installing Spark\n",
    "PySpark needs two things installed: Java and Spark.  \n",
    "If you use [databricks.com](databricks.com) you don't have to install any of this since everything is handled on their servers.  I've used databricks.com largely as a testing site to accompany the online class; it appears to be fully fledged in cluster deployment if you wish to use it that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Java\n",
    "Datacamp has a good overview of PySpark installation on [this page](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/apache-spark-python).  Note the [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) link in it is slightly dated (JDK SE8).  To get the most recent version of JDK, type `java` into the Terminal and choose \"more info\" on the ensuing dialog box.  As of March 2018, the newest version is [version 10](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html).  If you already have Java installed, this dialog box might not appear.  I'm unsure how you update Java then -- likely delete it and install a fresh new version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that Apple discontinued pre-installing Java on all their machines due to high frequency of security issues with Java.  Java will require you to frequently update it, but even in so doing you are exposing yourself to more malware risks through browser exposure.  Because of this, unless actively using it, [disabling Java is recommended](http://osxdaily.com/2012/09/08/how-to-disable-java/) and easy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Oracle, the makers of Java are [notorious for bundling adware](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2893607/software-integration/java-mac-ask-toolbar-oracle-itbwcw.html) into Java, causing users to have to [manually uninstall](https://www.imore.com/oracle-bundles-adware-mac-java-installer) the adware bloat.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to [uninstall Java entirely](http://osxdaily.com/2017/06/16/uninstall-java-mac/), you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lasting impression to take is this:  \n",
    "Unless you need to install Java on your Mac (in this case, for Spark), then don't do it.  If you do install it, complete your project in Spark, and then no longer acutely need it, you should disable it at the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Spark\n",
    "Download the [latest version of Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).  Unzip / tar the .zip/.tar file.  Move the resulting folder, which will be named something like `spark-2.3.0-bin-hadoop2.7`, to the following directory:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`/usr/local/spark`\n",
    "\n",
    "This directory may not exist yet, so create it first or use the command line from the `Downloads` directory, or wherever you untarred the Spark file (again, use whatever your Spark download version is):  \n",
    "\n",
    "`mv spark-2.3.0-bin-hadoop2.7 /usr/local/spark`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### PySpark\n",
    "As of 2018, PySpark is now available in PyPI and Anaconda (woohoo).  Install it with:\n",
    "`conda install pyspark` or `pip install pyspark`, depending upon your setup (favoring `conda` if you have Anaconda installed, of course).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run an interactive PySpark shell by entering the following command in the Terminal from the directory of your Spark install (e.g. `/usr/local/spark/spark-2.3.0-bin-hadoop2.7`):  \n",
    "\n",

    "#### Local Script / Notebook\n",
    "Note I used [databricks.com](databricks.com), a site created by one of the founders of Spark, as my Spark app.  \n",
    "If using a script / Notebook, would need to first create a Spark session with the following import:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n",
    "spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"<AppNameHere>\").getOrCreate()\n",
    "df = spark.read.csv('fft_clas_stats.csv')           # many read methods available\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This builder process can take a while depending on machine used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Databricks.com\n",
    "databricks.com runs instances of Spark in online Notebooks and allows a small 6 GB free cluster to be used.  We do not need to build a Spark session because every workspace in it is a session.  For PySpark, we only have to import it and define a SQL context for files we've uploaded, assuming they can be accessed via a SQL schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I uploaded my testing csv _du jour_, `fft_class_stats.csv`, to the \"data\" storage in my databricks account and then used it in my first PySpark DF test.  When you upload a local data file, you can and should specify the datatype for each column. (This is another reason this FFT csv is a great tester file, because it has `str`, `int`, and `float` dtypes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sqlContext` class was for Spark 1.0.  With the advent of Spark 2.0, it has been replaced by the `SparkSession` class above, though is kept alive for backward compatibility.  We cannot (to my knowledge) use the `.read.csv()` method in Databricks because it doesn't store uploaded data as a CSV (even if you upload an actual CSV) -- it is converted to a SQL DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the old way in databricks:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pyspark\n",
    "df = sqlContext.sql(\"SELECT * FROM fft_class_stats\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"fft\").getOrCreate()\n",
    "data = spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM fft_class_stats\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, we are using Spark SQL to return data from a SQL database instead of loading it directly from a .csv as above.\n",

    "## Spark Data Frames\n",
    "[Go back to the Table of Contents](#Contents)\n",
    "_______\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Spark 2.0, Spark and its various apps are transitioning to the more universal _data frame_ object, built on SQL databases, instead of the initial _RDD_.  Spark Data Frames are very similar to data frames of Pandas and R, happily.  Using PySpark offers welcomed overlap with Pandas commands and attributes.  Since Spark DFs are built on SQL databases, we also have the ability to leverage raw SQL queries to interact with Spark DFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some key differences between Spark DFs and Pandas/R DFs.  These differences stem from the distributed nature of a Spark DF vs. the local in-memory nature of Pandas and R DFs.  One significant fact to grasp is that a distributed Spark DF is _immutable_, thus we cannot assign new values or properties to an existing Spark DF and \"overwrite\" it.  Every operation that changes a Spark DF will result in a new Spark DF.  For example, we cannot change Column A in a Spark DF from a `string` to a `float` value via assignment, as we would in Pandas and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "## This is not allowed: 'DataFrame' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "df['Column_A'] = df['Column_A'].cast('float')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From Pandas\n",
    "We can convert a Pandas DF into a Spark SQL DF with the basic `createDataFrame` command by supplying an existing Pandas DF as the data:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`df_spark = SparkSession.createDataFrame(df_pandas)` -- v2.0 or newer  \n",
    "`df_spark = sqlContext.createDataFrame(df_pandas)` -- pre v2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "To go the other way and turn a Spark DF into a Pandas DF, simply use the `df.toPandas()` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Commands\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.read.csv(\"<path>.csv\")  \n",
    "df.printSchema()\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "root\n",
    " |-- Job_ID: string (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- Job: string (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- Identity: string (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- Gender: string (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- Level: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- Role: string (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- Association: string (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- HPm: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- MPm: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- PAm: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- MAm: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- SPm: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- Move: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- Jump: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- CEV: float (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- HPc: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- MPc: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- PAc: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- MAc: integer (nullable = true)\n",
    " |-- SPc: integer (nullable = true)    \n",
    "\n",
    "df.columns  \n",
    "df.describe()  \n",
    "df.head()  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Showing the Data\n",
    "Anytime we want to see the data, we must use a `.show()` method!  \n",
    "`.show(numRows, truncate)` -- both arguments optional; can use `.show(truncate=False)` to show all results.  __UPDATE__ I think this is incorrect...\n",
    "\n",
    "`df.describe().show(100)` -- would show up to 100 rows if that many are present.   \n",
    "`df.describe().show(truncate=False)` -- would show results.   \n",
    "`df.columns` -- show column names; note this is an _attribute_ and not a method, a'la Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collecting the Data\n",
    "As expected, the `.show` method simply prints out the results of an operation.  When we want to actually return the results so we can save them in a variable or process them, we must use `.collect`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`df.filter(df['Level'] > 20).collect()` would return (not show) a DF of characters whose level was >20.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The return type is a `list` of `Row` objects (see more below).  This means you will have to index into the collected list to access specific rows of data!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining Schema / Datatypes\n",
    "As usual, most true data is messy and Spark's internal type estimator will make mistakes or be stumped by mixed types in a column.  To manually enforce type as needed, use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyspark.sql.types import StructField, StringType, IntegerType, StructType\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use these constructors to create our own Schema for the DB we are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Creating Fields and Types\n",
    "Schemas can be defined by `StructType` constructors, which themselves are made up of `StructField` fields (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "`StructField(field_name, dtype, nullable)` is how we set a `dtype` for a specific column.  It has three arguments: __field name__ (str), __type__ (dtype), __bool nullable__ (T/F, can it be a `null` value?)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say the FFT csv import incorrectly interpreted the column `Level` as a `string` instead of an `int`.  Note I don't know if when passing a schema to the `.read` function, such as using `final_struct` below, if we must specify a `StructField` for _every_ column in the table or not.   I can't check until I install Spark on my local.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a list of our desired StructFields is assembled, we pass that into a `StructType` constructor and use that as our `schema` argument upon read in.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data_schema = [StructField(\"Level\", IntegerType(), True)]]\n",
    "final_struct = StructType(fields=data_schema)\n",
    "df = spark.read.csv('fft_clas_stats.csv', schema=final_struct)\n",
    "## Will this only modify the \"Level\" column leave the rest as is, or will it error b/c I left other columns undefined?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing Data in the Data Frame\n",
    "##### Dictionary-style Indexing\n",
    "Like Pandas DFs, a Spark DF uses dictionary-style indexing where we supply the key to the DF column(s) we want.  However, there are some additional steps to grabbing data.  If we just index in a'la a Pandas DF, we return a `Column` object (called a `Series` in Pandas), and this object is not something we can currently see via `.show()`.  For many of the operations needed when working in the Spark DF we will need to provide a `Column` data type -- don't forget that this is achieved using this Pandas style dictionary index.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "## This returns a 'Column' object:\n",
    "\n",
    "df['Level']\n",
    "## output: Column<b'Level'>\n",
    "\n",
    "type(df['Level'])\n",
    "## output: pyspark.sql.column.Column\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `.select()` Method\n",
    "In order to actually access the data, we must use the `.select()` method, akin to SQL.  And to _see_ the data, we must use the `.show()` method as noted above.  The printed result is akin to Pandas in IPython.  Using the `.select()` method returns a `DataFrame` object, _not_ a Spark `Column`.  Pandas doesn't operate this way, instead returning a `Series` whenever a single row or column is sliced.  This is an important difference, as it means all DF operations are uniformly valid whether we have chosen a single row/column or multiple!  \n",
    "\n",
    "_Small technical note_:  \n",
    "We can `.select()` a single column without enclosing it in a list, such as `df.select('Level')`, and Spark should handle this.  However, there are apparently times when this might not be the case, so it is a best practice to always enclose the columns desired in a `list` inside a `.select()` statement to avoid unexpected issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "## This returns a 'DataFrame' object:\n",
    "\n",
    "df.select(['Level'])\n",
    "## output: DataFrame[Level: int]\n",
    "\n",
    "df.select(['Level']).show()\n",
    "## output:\n",
    "+-----+\n",
    "|Level|\n",
    "+-----+\n",
    "|    1|\n",
    "|   10|\n",
    "|   26|\n",
    "|    1|\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "type(df.select('Level'))\n",
    "## output: pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Pandas, Spark DFs are `DataFrame` objects.  Unlike Pandas, Spark DFs also have separate `Column` and `Row` objects.  Slicing a row returns a `Row` object, same for a column as we saw above.  In Pandas, rows _and_ columns are actually the same type of object: a `Series`.  There are advantages to having a generalized grouping of data like a `Series`, but there are also advantages to having separate objects for both a row and a column, like Spark has.  The primary purpose for Spark's granular data types in the DF are a result of the precision needed in dealing with distributed data and computing.  Spark needs to know _exactly_ what operation is being done to which data and where that data is in the distributed system.  This makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had wanted to select multiple columns, we simply pass in a list of columns, `['Level', 'Role']`, as in Pandas.  _Note that since Spark DFs are distributed, we cannot (easily) access a single row, unlike in Pandas._  This is one of the larger differences between the two and one of the more difficult friction points in adapting to Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding or Renaming Columns\n",
    "Use the `.withColumn(name, data)` method to add new cols.  There are additions to this method for more complex operations, such as filtering and concatenation.  Note that this works when the column added (`data` in the function definition, here) is from the _same_ DF!  Appending a column from a separate DF is much messier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adding a Column Using Data From the Same Dataframe\n",
    "Arguments are __name__ (str) and __data__ (`Column` data type!).  \n",
    "Use `.withColumnRenamed(old_name, new_name)` to rename columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are __not__ in-place operations!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "## This adds a new column \"Double_Level\" which is just \"Level\" * 2\n",
    "df.withColumn('Double_Level', df['Level'] * 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use the `col` function to make the data a `Column` type if needed\n",
    "import pyspark.sql.functions as F\n",
    "df.withColumn('Double_Level', F.col(<some_non_col_data>) * 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rename a Column\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.withColumnRenamed('Level', 'A_New_Level')\n",
    "## Of confidence and power...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The other (non-`withColumn`) approaches include:\n",
    "1. Using SQL by registering a Temporary Table\n",
    "2. Pandas UDF\n",
    "3. RDDs\n",
    "\n",
    "They all work on a single table, meaning the data being added or manipulated must exist on the destination table already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more about them in these nice articles:\n",
    "1. [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-ways-to-add-a-new-column-in-a-pyspark-dataframe-4e75c2fd8c08). Very good, including how to train multiple individual models on each spark node (in Pandas UDF section)\n",
    "2. [Hackers and Slackers](https://hackersandslackers.com/transforming-pyspark-dataframes/) (very good)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adding a Column Using Data From a Separate Dataframe (Messy)\n",
    "Okay, this gets messy.  It kind of outright sucks, to be honest.  Apart from the traditional `.join()` method, there's not a defined way to do this (which I find perplexing).  There appear to be a couple methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Join on a specific column\n",
    "2. Create a unique identifier column to join on (caveat included)\n",
    "3. Use `.lit()` to create a column of a single, repeated value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Join\n",
    "Your standard SQL join that is also used in Pandas\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Here are a couple articles giving details of these approaches.\n",
    "2. [Spark By Example](https://sparkbyexamples.com/spark/spark-add-new-column-to-dataframe/)\n",
    "3. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47028442/add-column-from-one-dataframe-to-another-dataframe-in-scala/47028782)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using SQL Directly\n",
    "Since this is a `spark.sql` DF, we can use SQL to access it directly.  To do so, we must first create a \"temporary SQL view\" and then use traditional SQL queries.  As someone who has basic knowledge of SQL, this doesn't appeal to me very much, but it is a nice feature and allows colleagues who have advanced SQL knowledge the ability to interact with Spark via SQL queries if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "## View name as str, replaces if previously made.\n",
    "df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"FFT_Sql\")\n",
    "\n",
    "results = spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM FFT_Sql\")\n",
    "results.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to use some DF methods without creating the SQL View table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "## Uses the generalized df.filter() method with SQL query syntax.\n",
    "df.filter(\"Level > 20\").show()\n",
    "\n",
    "## Can chain with .select() to return only specified columns.\n",
    "df.filter(\"Level > 20\").select(['Identity', 'Level']).show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filtering / Sub-selecting Data\n",
    "This is how we will be operating on the data, generally.  It is very similar to Pandas masking, syntactically. The chained `.select()` method is optional, of course.  The same rules of using `&`, `|`, and `~` for the `and`, `or`, and `not` operators also apply, as does the rule of enclosing each condition of a multiple condition filter/mask in parentheses.\n",

Instead you must specify the col and aggregation desired in a `.agg(dict)` call.  Dict (or list) comprehension is our friend, here.  Also can traditional aggregation methods, like `.sum` or `.mean`, etc. for the entire grouped frame.  Can also use SQL star `*` to select all cols in the `.agg` call.\n",

    "Spark SQL has no \"index\", so things like a \"multi-index\" in Pandas do not apply.  In order to convert a Pandas MultiIndex to a Spark SQL DF, you have to flatten the Pandas DF first (i.e. `reset_index(drop=False, inplace=True)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### NaNs\n",
    "PySpark DFs use the `.na` class attribute to interact with DF / row / col NaN values.  The functionality is nearly identical to Pandas.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.na.drop()                    # drops via row, any with NaN\n",
    "df.na.drop(thresh=3)            # drops any row that has fewer than 3 non-null entries\n",
    "df.na.drop(how='any')           # default arg.\n",
    "df.na.drop(how='all')           # drops any row that has ONLY NaN vals\n",
    "df.na.drop(subset=['ColA'])     # choose cols to consider NaNs in\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, when filling NaNs, Spark only fills by matching data types.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.na.fill(0)                   # Will only replace NaN in numeric columns\n",
    "df.na.fill(\"0\")                 # Will only replace NaN in string columns\n",
    "df.na.fill(0, subset=['ColA'])  # Will only replace NaN in ColA if it is numeric...\n",

    "#### Casting Columns to Datatypes\n",
    "Apparently many operations on a Spark DF cause the datatype to be converted to a `string`.  So, a DF with correct numeric dtypes will be converted to all `string` upon using, say, `df.describe()`.  This creates problems for subsequent methods, obviously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `.cast()` method to cast a column to a different data type.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['Level'].cast('float')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operating on Multiple Columns\n",
    "I'm unsure of how to operate using a `.map()` or `.apply()` type method.  For now, I am using list comprehensions to act as a sort of mapping function.  So, using the `format_number` and `.cast()` methods from above, I will show an example of how to use list comps to greatly reduce the coding overhead for repeated operations. It leverages the `*` unpacking operator inside the `.select()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the FFT DF, there are a mix of numeric and `string` columns.  If I want to perform an operation on only the numeric columns, such as `format_number`, I have to first get them and then repeat the operation.  These numeric cols are assigned to the variable `numeric_cols` below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pretend however that we've done some DF-level operation, such as `.describe()` that (apparently) re-types every column as a `string`, much to our chagrin.  The results of the `.describe()` operation are very long and unreadable numbers (of `string` type, mind you).  We want to fix this by using `format_number` to limit the values to two decimal places.  But since they're all `string` dtype, we can't use `format_number` on them until we first `.cast()` them into a numeric dtype, like `float`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base, brute force way to achieve this is to code every single desired column into the `.select()` statement, which is laborious, error-prone, and nigh unreadable.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Brute Force Way\n",
    "```python\n",
    "## After an operation that casts the numeric cols to string\n",
    "df.select(format_number(dfd['Level'].cast('float'), 2).alias('Level'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['HPm'].cast('float'), 2).alias('HPm'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['MPm'].cast('float'), 2).alias('MPm'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['PAm'].cast('float'), 2).alias('PAm'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['MAm'].cast('float'), 2).alias('MAm'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['SPm'].cast('float'), 2).alias('SPm'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['Move'].cast('float'), 2).alias('Move'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['Jump'].cast('float'), 2).alias('Jump'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['CEV'].cast('float'), 2).alias('CEV'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['HPc'].cast('float'), 2).alias('HPc'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['MPc'].cast('float'), 2).alias('MPc'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['PAc'].cast('float'), 2).alias('PAc'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['MAc'].cast('float'), 2).alias('MAc'),\n",
    "              format_number(dfd['SPc'].cast('float'), 2).alias('SPc'),\n",
    "             ).show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we could use a `.map()` method to apply the operations above repeatedly, but until I figure that out, here is the list comp approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Concise Way\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numeric_cols = ['Level', 'HPm', 'MPm', 'PAm', 'MAm', 'SPm', 'Move', 'Jump', 'CEV', 'HPc', 'MPc', 'PAc', 'MAc', 'SPc']\n",
    "format_cols = [format_number(dfd[col].cast('float'), 2).alias(col) for col in numeric_cols]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note the unpacking '*' use, since .select() is a function. Otherwise we'd just pass in a list of cols and that wouldn't work.\n",
    "df.select(*format_cols).show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These two blocks of code achieve the same result!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note the use of `.cast()` inside the `format_number` method, since we must convert to a numeric dtype before we can format it as such.  Recall the `.alias()` call at the end is simply renaming the now-changed column to its original name, else it would have a garish name like: `format_number(dfd['SPc'].cast('float'), 2)`, which is an affront to all literate humanity.\n",

    "Well, it turns out that our data is _not_ very predictable using only the numeric features.  With a mean `Level` around 11 for the full `model_data` dataset, our two error metrics are around 10 and 14.  That's pretty bad.  Further, the standard deviation of the `model_data` is _larger_ than the mean of the data, by about 1.5x.  That tells us without even building a model that the data is likely to be highly challenging to predict.  Finally, our `r2` value helps confirm that our model is not doing a good job of explaining the variance observed in this data.\n",

    "Tree models allow the use of _feature importances_ to see which features had the biggest impact on prediction.  We can only see the feature importances for the training data because we have to know the correct prediction answers to evaluate which features were most important.\n",

That list is, of course, the list of columns used to make predictions in our model, and its order is maintained in the output of the model's `.featureImportances` attribute.  This allows us to pair the feature names with their importances, as shown below.\n",

    "The two most common types of recommender systems are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Content-based\n",
    "+ Collaborative Filtering (CF)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Content-based__ systems focus on the attributes of the items themselves.  If you like these three songs that all have a funky bass line and a horn section, we think you will probably like this new song that has those same qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Collaborative Filtering__ systems focus on the preferences of the users and employ an approach known as \"widom of the crowds,\" where a large population of users rate items (films, shoes, furniture, etc....) and their ratings are used as guides to make recommendations to other users.  Further data slicing can be done so that users are clustered, such as \"one sub-population of people like these five action films, and also like this other, more obscure action film.  You also like those five action films, so it's likely you will also like the more obscure film.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In general Collaborative Filtering tends to be used more initially due to ease of use (it's harder to quantify different features of products, like a film, which is what Content-based systems require).  It also tends to be equal or better in recommendations.  It also has the advantage of being able to learn which features are most important on its own as new recommendations are made and their results are tracked with time.  `spark.ml` uses Alternating Least Squares (ALS) to learn about these latent factors.  Mathematically, we are taking a sparse, high-dimensional matrix of users v. item ratings and, via identification of the latent factors, decomposing it to smaller user factors and item factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, most real-world recommender systems use a combination of both types, serving to reinforce any recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark MLlib library for Machine Learning provides a Collaborative Filtering implementation by using Alternating Least Squares. The implementation in MLlib has these parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ numBlocks is the number of blocks used to parallelize computation (set to -1 to auto-configure).\n",
    "+ rank is the number of latent factors in the model.\n",
    "+ iterations is the number of iterations to run.\n",
    "+ lambda specifies the regularization parameter in ALS.\n",

    "Like other models, we will do a train-test data split.  Unlike other models, recommender systems often deal with user subjectivity regarding specific items.  This makes \"trusting\" the reliability of a recommender system more difficult in some scenarios.  The canonical example is that a user might not like Star Trek just because they like Star Wars, despite the recommender system believing that they should. (I would be one of those users, by the way).  Perhaps more than any other model, recommender systems need large amounts of data (both distinct items and users) to arrive at reliable conclusions.\n",

    "## Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "NLP has a number of approaches and toolkits.  In Python, NLTK is the _de facto_ library to start with, though I am sure there are now more advanced ones available.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the hallmarks of NLP is that text / written data can be much messier than numerical data, and as a result there is frequently significant overhead in preparing the data for modeling.  A good example is \"The dog ran to the corner\" vs. \"Later, the dog RAN to the corner and grabbed his bone.\"  Depending on how you prepare the data, and which model utilities you use, these two sentences could be considered as identical, highly similar, marginally similar, or completely different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "If you simply analyze for a match on the shortest string possible, \"The dog ran to the corner\" in our case, then both sentences would be matched as 100% identical since this exact string is in both.  If you don't control for the \"RAN\" capitalization, then the strings might not be counted as being as similar or even a match at all. If you don't tokenize the words and sort them, then they might not match since the second example begins with \"Later, \"... you get the idea.  NLP can be very ticky-tacky.\n",

The model produces sparse representations for the documents over the vocabulary, which can then be passed to other algorithms like LDA.\n",

An optional parameter minDF also affects the fitting process by specifying the minimum number (or fraction if < 1.0) of documents a term must appear in to be included in the vocabulary. Another optional binary toggle parameter controls the output vector. If set to true all non-zero counts are set to 1. This is especially useful for discrete probabilistic models that model binary, rather than integer, counts.\n",
